# Hi there, welcome to my profile! 👋

My name is Andrew Plummer. I'm an Ottawa-based researcher working with the Bank of Canada's Climate Analysis Team 🌲 

## Recent Professional Accomplishments

- 📈 Used Python to forecast expected credit losses across various loan portfolio under severe, but plausible, climate scenarios as part of a larger project to analyze the systemic risks from transitioning to a low-carbon economy  
- 🏠 Used Python to develop a machine learning model to estimate Canadian house prices as part of a larger work to understand the risks that a warming climate poses to Canada's housing sector 
- 🏦 Used Microsoft Excel/VBA to develop a dashboard that shows several risk metrics for wholesale loans portfolios. This dashboard is currently used in the risk departments of some of the largest financial institutions in Canada   

## Personally 

- This Fall, I will be pursuing my M.A. in Economics to expand my knowledge of econometric techniques 🧮
